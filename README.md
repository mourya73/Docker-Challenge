# Midterm Project: Docker Challenge

This is for my midterm project, the Docker Challenge. In this project, I aim to demonstrate my understanding and proficiency in using Docker for containerization.

By leveraging Docker, I will be able to create isolated and reproducible environments for my application. This will allow for easier deployment, scalability, and collaboration with other developers.
